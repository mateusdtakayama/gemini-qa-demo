<h2 id="about">üìå About</h2>

<h3>Vision Project</h3>
This application is a Q&A demo built with Streamlit and integrates Google's Gemini LLM with image analysis capabilities. Users can upload images and provide text inputs to generate contextually relevant responses. The interface is designed to handle both image and text inputs, providing an easy way to interact with the model and visualize the generated answers.

<h3>App Project</h3>
This application is a straightforward Q&A demo using Streamlit and the Google Gemini LLM. It focuses on generating responses based on user-provided questions. The interface is simple and user-friendly, enabling users to interact with the model efficiently and view the responses generated by the LLM.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

<h3>1. Cloning the Repository</h3>

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mateusdtakayama/gemini-qa-demo
cd gemini-qa-demo
```

<h3>2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment</h3>

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. Follow these steps:

2.1 Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2.2 Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

<h3>3. Configuring the Google API Key</h2>

To utilize Google services in this project, such as the Gemini language model or image analysis, you'll need to configure your Google API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

3.1 Obtain Your Google API Key

Visit the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api">Google Gemini API website</a> .
Sign in with your Google account and follow the instructions to generate an API key.
Copy the API key that is provided.

3.2 Store the API Key Securely

In your project directory, create a .env file if it doesn't already exist.

Add your API key to the .env file in the following format:

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
```

Replace your-google-api-key-here with the API key you obtained from Google Cloud.

<h3>4. Starting</h3>

4.1 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.2 Start the Text-Based Q&A Application

To run the text-based Q&A application, which uses the app.py script, execute the following command:]

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit application and open it in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the Gemini LLM via text input.

4.3 Start the Image and Text Q&A Application

To run the application that supports both image and text inputs, which uses the vision.py script, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run vision.py
```

This will start the Streamlit application for image and text interaction, also opening it in your default web browser.
